    overview: ""
  positions:
  - designation: Research Associate
    start: Jan 2022
    responsibilities:
      - "Developed and strategically optimized the electrode process chain: From transition metal oxides (Ni, Fe, Co) to functional coatings, covering formulation design, deposition (ultrasonic spray coating, doctor blade, airbrush), wetting/drying behaviour, and quality control for energy storage systems (electrolysers and fuel cells)"
      - "Conducted electrochemical performance analysis of spray-coated electrode layers for green hydrogen production via alkaline water electrolysis (AWE)"
      - "Evaluated the scalability and transferability of model-based coatings onto nickel mesh substrates for practical integration into AWE cells"
      - "Supported R&D project proposals by identifying key knowledge gaps in anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis, forecasting future needs, and backing proposals with data-driven analysis"
      - "Collaborated closely with research and industrial partners on sample exchange, knowledge transfer, and communication within the PrometH2eus project (H2Giga framework)"
      - "Implemented agile practices by resolving workflow inefficiencies, improving data management, and enhancing collaboration within the research group"
